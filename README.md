# Deep Learning for Predicting Credit Card Defaults
ECM2423 - AI and Applications Coursework - Written in Python

Grade: 86%, First

*This project was for my AI and Applications course at Uni of Exeter. In this project I demonstrated my understanding of:*
  - Data Preprocessing and Handling Imbalanced Datasets
  - Model Optimisation and Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Evaluation and Interpretation of Model Performance

## Description
a) Design a deep learning technique for predicting credit card
defaults from the CCD (credit card default) dataset.

b) Validate and evaluate the performance of the model.

c) Write a short report (2000 words max) to describe the
architecture of the model, the training process, main deep
learning challenging problem, your findings and attempts to
cope with the challenging problem and improve the
performance of the AI system.
